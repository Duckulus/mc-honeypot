# `mc-honeypot`

This is a server-side implementation of minecraft's [Server List Ping Protocol](https://wiki.vg/Server_List_Ping). It
logs all incoming connections. The server's appearance in the client server list is fully customizable. This
implementation supports both the current protocol (1.7+) and the legacy protocol (1.6 and below).

## Why

There are certain people who use programs to scan the internet for minecraft servers. I wanted a simple way to collect
metrics about these scanning tools that does not involve running an actual minecraft server.
